# heart-disease-classification--- Milestone Project 1: Supervised Learning (Classification)
In this project we looked into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

Following approach:

1. Problem definition
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Features
5. Modelling
6. Experimentation

We looked at the following topics.
* **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)** - the process of going through a dataset and finding out more about it.
* **Model training** - create model(s) to learn to predict a target variable based on other variables.
* **Model evaluation** - evaluating a models predictions using problem-specific evaluation metrics. 
* **Model comparison** - comparing several different models to find the best one.
* **Model fine-tuning** - once we've found a good model, how can we improve it?
* **Feature importance** - since we're predicting the presence of heart disease, are there some things which are more important for prediction?
* **Cross-validation** - if we do build a good model, can we be sure it will work on unseen data?
* **Reporting what we've found** - if we had to present our work, what would we show someone?
